# Definition of Done Checklist

## Core Requirements ✅ (Fully Implemented)

### Accept uploaded logs (JSON format)

- ✅ POST /logs endpoint implemented
- ✅ JSON validation and parsing
- ✅ Proper error handling

### Store logs in database

- ✅ SQLite with TypeORM implementation
- ✅ Proper database schema and migrations
- ✅ Efficient querying capabilities

### API Endpoints

- ✅ GET /logs - List all logs with pagination
- ✅ GET /logs?severity=error&after=... - Filtering by severity and timestamp
- ✅ GET /stats - Return counts per severity level

### Data Validation & Security

- ✅ Input validation using class-validator
- ✅ Error handling middleware
- ✅ Type safety with TypeScript
- ✅ Basic security measures

## Bonus Features (Partially Implemented)

### Anonymization of sensitive fields

- ❌ Not implemented yet
- This is a key requirement for healthcare data

## Design Reflection Document (Not Started)

- ❌ Design choices and trade-offs
- ❌ Production considerations
- ❌ AWS deployment strategy
- ❌ Future expansion plans

## Technical Requirements ✅ (Fully Implemented)

### TypeScript with Node.js

- ✅ Full TypeScript implementation
- ✅ Type definitions for all components

### SQLite Data Store

- ✅ SQLite with TypeORM
- ✅ Proper database configuration
- ✅ Migration support

### REST API

- ✅ Express implementation
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes

## README.md

❌ Needs to be updated with:

- Setup instructions
- API documentation
- Development guidelines

## Areas Needing Attention

### Critical (Should be done within timebox)

- Create the Design Reflection Document (1-2 pages)
- Implement patient_id anonymization
- Update README with proper documentation

### Important but Optional (if time permits)

- Add more sophisticated filtering options
- Implement caching
- Add monitoring
- Enhance security features

## Recommendation for Next Steps

Based on the task definition and timebox (6-8 hours), I recommend we focus on:

### Design Reflection Document (1-2 hours)

- This is explicitly required in the task definition
- Should cover design choices, production considerations, AWS deployment, and future expansion

### Patient ID Anonymization (1-2 hours)

- This is mentioned as a bonus but is crucial for healthcare data
- Could be implemented as a middleware or service layer

### README Documentation (30 mins - 1 hour)

- Update with setup instructions
- Add API documentation
- Include development guidelines
