# Definition of Done Checklist

## Core Requirements ✅ (Fully Implemented)

### Accept uploaded logs (JSON format)

- ✅ POST /logs endpoint implemented
- ✅ JSON validation and parsing
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Matches example log format from task definition

### Store logs in database

- ✅ SQLite with TypeORM implementation
- ✅ Proper database schema and migrations
- ✅ Efficient querying capabilities

### API Endpoints

- ✅ GET /logs - List all logs with pagination
- ✅ GET /logs?severity=error&after=... - Filtering by severity and timestamp
- ✅ GET /stats - Return counts per severity level

### Data Validation & Security

- ✅ Input validation using class-validator
- ✅ Error handling middleware
- ✅ Type safety with TypeScript
- ✅ Basic security measures
- ✅ CORS support implemented
- ✅ Rate limiting implemented

## Bonus Features ✅ (Fully Implemented)

### Anonymization of sensitive fields

- ✅ Patient ID anonymization using SHA-256
- ✅ Consistent hashing (same ID always hashes to same value)
- ✅ One-way hashing for security
- ✅ Applied before database storage
- ✅ Unit tests for anonymization

## Design Reflection Document ✅ (Completed)

- ✅ Design choices and trade-offs
  - Database choice (SQLite with TypeORM)
  - API design (REST with Express)
  - Security measures (Patient ID anonymization)
  - Data validation (Class-validator + TypeORM)
- ✅ Production considerations
  - Privacy (anonymization, rate limiting, CORS)
  - Scaling (current limitations and improvements)
  - Monitoring (current and needed improvements)
- ✅ AWS deployment strategy
  - Infrastructure (ECS, RDS, ElastiCache)
  - Security (WAF, Shield, Secrets Manager)
  - Monitoring (CloudWatch, X-Ray, CloudTrail)
  - CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Future expansion plans
  - User authentication & authorization
  - Audit logging
  - Feature expansion
  - Performance optimization
